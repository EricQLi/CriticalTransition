## Abstract

Much effort has been devoted to understand the mechanisms of community assembly and dynamics. In principle the emphasis were on deterministic mechanisms based in niche differences between species, later the emphasis shifted to stochastic mechanisms based in neutral dynamics with identical individuals. And finally a unified view that accepts that both kinds of mechanisms are present at the same time and try to quantify the importance of these in natural communities. Following this view I present a model that unify the Tilman's model of hierarchical competition with the classical neutral model using one parameter $\rho$ to link them in a spatially extended system. In this model a phase transition that produce a biodiversity collapse is observed. This phase transition is characteristic of some ecological systems and has been termed robust criticality. Here we describe for the first time the observation of this kind of criticality for a community assembly model. 

## Abstract

Ecological communities are shaped by a mixture of niche-based and neutral ecological processes. In neutral communities individuals are identical except for is abundance in a metacommunity and the dynamics is dominated by demographic stochasticity and dispersal. Niche communities can be represented by competitive hierarchies were replacement of competitive superior species occurs. Here I present the most simple model representing the continuum of neutral-niche communities. I add to a classical neutral model a competitive hierarchy where each species have a probability $\rho$ of replace another species that measures competitive intensity. 
In this model shows a phase transition between neutral an niche communities that produce a spanning cluster of the most competitive species is observed. The diversity (measured with Shannon index) have and abrupt fall but richness shows a slower decrease. The critical point is observed at a very low value of the competitive intensity, thus weak competition can have a strong effect on communities. Some recent studies suggest that most communities present weak competitive interactions thus they may be near the critical point, understanding the dynamics this phase transition will be very important to prevent shifts in community structure.  

## Abstract (to present the model and this lack of trade-off)

Ecological communities are shaped by a mixture of niche-based and neutral ecological processes. In neutral communities individuals are identical except for is abundance in a metacommunity and the dynamics is dominated by demographic stochasticity and dispersal. Niche communities can be represented by competitive hierarchies and to maintain diversity some form of trade-off is assumed. Here I present the most simple model representing the continuum of neutral-niche communities. I add to a classical neutral model a competitive hierarchy where each species have a probability $\rho$ of replace another species. 
The model shows a phase transition between neutral an niche communities that produce a biodiversity collapse. This phase transition is characteristic of some ecological systems and has been termed robust criticality. Here we describe for the first time the observation of this kind of criticality for a community assembly model.  

## Abstract

The dynamics of ecological communities can be described by two contrasting models: one assumes that the individuals of all species are identical and do not have competitive interactions, the second assumes that species are different, adapted to particular habitat conditions and have strong interactions. These represent extremes of a continuum: the first is the neutral and the later the niche model of communities. Real communities are a mixture of both dynamics. Here I study the simplest model of neutral-niche communities where niche dynamics is represented as a competitive hierarchy. A parameter modulates the transition between the extremes: the competition intensity. I use an stochastic cellular automata to show that there is a phase transition between the neutral and niche model with a spanning cluster formed by the most abundant species. The transition implies a sharp fall of species diversity (Shannon entropy) but the richness (number of species) shows a gentle decline with increasing competitive intensity. The critical point is at a very low value of competitive intensity, the same was reported for different real communities, thus understanding this transition could be useful to prevent biodiversity loss.
