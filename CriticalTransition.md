## Abstract

Much effort has been devoted to understand the mechanisms of community assembly and dynamics. In principle the emphasis were on deterministic mechanisms based in niche differences between species, later the emphasis shifted to stochastic mechanisms based in neutral dynamics with identical individuals. And finally a unified view that accepts that both kinds of mechanisms are present at the same time and try to quantify the importance of these in natural communities. Following this view I present a model that unify the Tilman's model of hierarchical competition with the classical neutral model using one parameter $\rho$ to link them in a spatially extended system. In this model a phase transition that produce a biodiversity collapse is observed. This phase transition is characteristic of some ecological systems and has been termed robust criticality. Here we describe for the first time the observation of this kind of criticallity for a community assembly model.
