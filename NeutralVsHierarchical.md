# Tilman versus Hubbell 

In a clasical neutral model when an individual dies ( with rate $\mu$) is replaced by an individual of a local species with a probability $(1-m)$ weighted by the local density. With a probability $m$ can be replaced by a species from a metacommunity (regional species pool) weighted by the frecuency of the species in the metacommunity $X_k$

The probability of the species $k$ to increase in size from n to n+1 is

$W^{+}(n_{k})=\mu (J-n_{k})\left((1-m)\frac{n_{k}}{J-1}+mX_{k}\right)$
 
The probability of the species $k$ to decrease in size from n to n-1 is

$W^{-}(n_{k})=\mu n_{k}\left((1-m)\frac{J-n_{k}}{J-1}+m(1-X_{k})\right)$
 

For the hierarchical mean field model the probabilities are:

The probability of the species $k$ to increase in size from n to n+1 is 

$\displaystyle W^{+}(n_{k})=(J-n_{k}) \left(\mu \left((1-m)\frac{n_{k}}{J-1}+mX_{k}\right) + (1-\mu)\left(\sum_{j=k+1}^{S}\frac{n_j}{J}\right)\frac{n_k}{J}\rho \right)$

The probability of the species $k$ to decrease in size from n to n-1 is

$\displaystyle W^{-}(n_{k})=\mu n_{k}\left((1-m)\frac{J-n_{k}}{J-1}+m(1-X_{k})\right)+(1-\mu)\left(\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\frac{n_j}{J}\right)\frac{n_k}{J}\rho$
