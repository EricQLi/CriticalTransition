# Notes

### percolation
The simplest mechanism that produces scale invariance is percolation, physically describes the movement of a fluid through porous media. One can think about a two dimensional landscape where each site is connected to the others neighbors with some probability $p$. The landscape will be connected when $p$ reaches some threshold value . 


The most common species in a neutral community should coincide with the most common species in the metacommunity, probably a species with high dispersal capabilities. But a hierarchycal community, if the community is at steady state, the most common species will be the most competitive. If you study the traits of the most common and the community is near steady state you will know what are the principal forces structuring the community.


* biodiversity collapse [@Sole2004c]

* Multispecies early indicators [@Dakos2014]

* The most competitive species could be seem as non-habitable patch produced by deforestation, and the intensity of competition is a measure of growth rate of deforestation. It has been seen that deforested patches become abandoned due to economic crisis or changes reglamentations and management [@Haddad2015;Hansen2013]. Besides the growth and decay of unhabitable patches should be different from other species rates of invasions (here we assumed all equal) the qualitative features should be the same taking into account that near the percolation threshold the details of the models do not modify the behavior of the system. Thus based on these we can establish that about a 30% percent non-habitable patches can produce a biodiversity collapse if communities live near a critical interaction/competitive intensity. A similar approach taking into account the interplay between two dynamic processes: habitat loss/recuperation and 1 species population spread [@Oborny2007]. found a critical threshold on the same order: 27% of non-habitable patches.

The Sørensen index is $S_12/[0.5(S_1 + S_2 )]$, where S12
is the number of species common to both sites and
Si is the total found at site i. Jaccard’s index is

trees separated by distances between r and $r + \Delta r$
and then determining what proportion of these

A serious difficulty with this neutral model is its extreme sensitivity 
to the neutrality assumption. 

Once differences between species are allowed, then competitive 
exclusion is likely to occur rapidly.

More generally, the June 2006 issue of Ecology contained a series 
of papers in a special feature on 

neutral community ecology (Naeem, 2006). 

The degree of apparent community structure—niche rather than 
neutral— depends on many factors, including number of species (diversity), 
degree of niche overlap, dispersal abilities, and assumptions 
made about environmental variability (Gravel et al., 2006). 

The theme is re-echoed, with variations, by Bonsall et al. (2004b), 
who show how ‘organization dominated by niche structure and organization through chance and 
neutral processes’ can operate simultaneously, with varying weights, depending on the interplay between population dynamics (ecology) and life-history trade offs (evolution).

As in all such quests, it is good to keep in mind Einstein’s dictum, 
which translates roughly as ‘seek simplicity, and distrust 
it’.

Some ecologists feel uncomfortable with neutral theory be cause 
it is wrong in the sense that it assumes species equivalence in 
the face of a vast literature cataloguing species differences 
and because it subsumes many undoubtedly real and well-researched 
ecological processes under the umbrella of stochasticity, 
which does not itself really constitute a force of nature (26).

Dakos2014

We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinction.

@Gravel2006 Reconciling niche and neutrality: the continuum hypothesis.


For simplicity, we assume species are equal in their death probability, although it is obvious that differentiation could also occur through this process. The models also focus on the local community scale. Thus, we do not consider speciation, and we recognize that further work is necessary to unify the models at the metacommunity scale.

	
It has been argued that observing patterns of species abundance 
typically predicted by neutral models cannot necessarily be 
taken as evidence of neutral processes (Purves & Pacala 2005), 
and our results concur with that. However, our results also show 
that the observed patterns can result from a neutral drift created 
by an elevated niche overlap, sustained by the constant reintro- 
duction of excluded species through high immigration and/ or 
speciation rates. Under such conditions, the rare species are 
transients and their occurrence depends on immigration; on 
the other hand, the resident species are permanent and their 
occurrence depends on niche differentiation (Magurran & Henderson 
2003; Schwilk & Ackerly 2005). 


Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity.

A community solely driven by competition will have a
deterministic succession, while a neutral community will
have the maximum stochasticity among replicated succes-
sions because of the neutral drift (Clark & McLachlan 2003).
We used this proxy to assess ÔneutralityÕ when we tested the
different predictions presented above.

The index was calculated after 500 time steps. This is not a sufficient
run length to reach a truly stable species composition, but
preliminary simulations showed that index differences
among scenarios were similar when the run length was
longer than 500 time steps

@Kefi2011

The percolation probability was
estimated using 500 · 500 lattices. The system is considered to be percolated when it has
at least one patch that spans from one edge of the system to the opposite edge. The
location of the percolation point is defined as the parameter value at which the percolation
probability is 0.5 (see the Results for further details about the percolation point).
The patch size distributions were obtained as follows. Simulations were run for
10 000 time units. The first 3000 transient time steps were discarded. Thereafter, patch
size data were recorded every 40 snapshots, to minimize any temporal correlation
among successive snapshots. Data from 175 such snapshots were used to plot the patch
size distribution.

# discussion
Our results suggest that tracking changes in patch size distributions
associated with knowledge on the connectedness of the system (and more specifically
on the presence or absence of spanning clusters) might provide qualitative information
regarding the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem.

Additionally, the patch size distribution can provide some information about
underlying ecological mechanisms. We showed that systems with the same cover (but
different underlying ecological mechanism) can be described by different distributions
(Fig. 2; Appendix S3). Considering a real ecosystem and knowing its fractional cover,
the patch size distribution can be compared with the patch size distribution generated
by a null model for the same fractional cover. An excess in large patches compared with
the null model would mean that local interactions might be at play, as a mechanism
promoting longer spatial correlations than expected otherwise.

@Orrock2010 Local community size mediates ecological drift and competition in metacommunities

The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e.g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt

@Fort2013a  Tropical Forests Are Non-Equilibrium Ecosystems Governed by Interspecific Competition Based on Universal 1/6 Niche Width

This niche width yields an average ratio of 0.25 between interspecific and intraspecific competition that corresponds to an intermediate value between the extreme claims of the neutral model and the classical niche-based model of community assembly (where interspecific competition is dominant).


------------------------
@Martorell2014 Testing the roles of competition, facilitation and stochasticity on community structure in a species-rich assemblage

Most ecologists would agree that interactions and stochasticity occur concurrently in ecological communities. Neutrality may operate within subsets of closely related or convergent species (Leibold & McPeek 2006; Scheffer & van Nes 2006; Vergnon, Dulvy & Freckleton 2009), or among species pairs with similar fitness (equalizing mechanisms). However, increasing niche differentiation is required for coexistence to occur as asymmetries in competitive ability become greater (stabilizing mechanisms; Chesson 2000b; Adler, HilleRis- Lambers & Levine 2007). Furthermore, immigration may counteract competitive exclusion in interconnected metacommunities, reducing the degree of niche organization required for diversity maintenance (Gravel et al. 2006). Nevertheless, stochasticity is expected to set more restrictive conditions to coexistence in interaction-driven communities (May 1973; Tilman 2004; Adler & Drake 2008).

Empirical evidence is still insufficient to settle the conflict between these theories. Community patterns expected from theories based on interactions and stochasticity are frequently indistinguishable (Hubbell 2001; Chave, Muller-Landau & Levin 2002; Rosindell, Hubbell & Etienne 2011),

The fact that intraspecific competition (altogether with stochasticity) was able to explain
most of the variance in species abundance in our community would appear to support his claims. Nevertheless, the same pattern would be expected if the community were structured by interspecific competition, which would cause extinctions until only a set of species that are more limited by conspecific than heterospecific interactions remained (Chesson 2000b).

Our results, taken together with recent studies on tropical forests, suggest that weak interactions among established plants may be a general phenomenon, but that local interactions during colonization are important drivers of community composition.

----------------------
@Volkov2009

Both approaches yield very similar answers and show
that the collective effects of the pairwise interspecific interaction
strengths are weak compared with the intraspecific interactions.
Our approaches can be applied to other ecological communities
in steady state to evaluate the extent to which interactions need
to be incorporated into theoretical explanations for their structure
and dynamics.

However, both models have different underlying assumptions and
complement each other, and the degree of accord is noteworthy.
In general, from a quantitative perspective, both approaches lead
to the conclusion that the effects of interspecific interactions are
relatively weak and impose a relatively minor constraint on species
dynamics in the BCI forest (Fig. 3). It is as though evolution has
chosen weakly interacting species for proximal coexistence.

@Chisholm2010

niche theory and neutral theory are two
major families of theoretical models that aim to explain patterns
of biodiversity observed in nature (1, 2). Niche theory, which has
a long history of development (3–5), assumes that different species
are regulated by different environmental factors and proposes that
diversity arises from spatial and temporal environmental hetero-
geneity (6). Neutral theory, which was developed more recently
from the theory of island biogeography (7), assumes that species
are equivalent and proposes that diversity arises from a balance
between immigration, speciation, and extinction (8–10)

in which a semiisolated local community receives immigrants from a much larger metacommunity that is assumed to be static relative to the timescale of the local community 

Our results confirm that the neutral model of species abundances emerges from more complex models (29) at sufficiently large scales, sufficiently high levels of diversity, and sufficiently low niche dimensionality.

Eco-evolutionary responses of biodiversity to climate change.

F1000 Recommendation - DOI: 10.3410/f.717967699.793467371

This interesting study investigates the role of multi-species interactions and evolutionary processes in determining species extinction due to a changing climate. Current predictions of the effect of climate change on biodiversity commonly overlook processes of species interactions and the possibility of adaptation to a changing climate. In this study, Norberg et al. develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. Their study suggests that species with higher genetic variance and shorter dispersal distances are less likely to become extinct due to climate change. This is because reduced connectivity facilitates the fixation of mutations that may allow species to adapt to the new environmental conditions. 

This contradicts the current understanding that populations well-connected at large spatial scales are less vulnerable to disturbances. The rationale behind this idea is that isolated populations have a greater difficulty to recover from disturbances, since they do not receive recruits from other locations. In terms of management for conservation, this has led to an effort in designing networks of protected areas that maximise the connectivity among populations (e.g. spacing of marine protected areas and green corridors). While maximising connectivity is a valid practice to minimise risks of extinction due to habitat fragmentation and episodic acute disturbances, Norberg et al.'s findings suggest it might not be ideal to face climate change. Thus, instead of aiming to 'maximise' connectivity, maybe we should start aiming to 'optimise' connectivity. 

The authors also highlight the role of competition in the extinction of species and predict the occurrence of extinction and evolutionary debts, i.e. changes in species richness that occur long after the climate stabilises.

@Rosindell2011 The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography at Age Ten.

Many different models can explain the same sampled
species abundance data [16–18]. Even models based on
neutral theory, but introducing a particular niche struc-
ture, give mathematically identical results to the classic
neutral model at large spatial scales [19,20]. On the one
hand, this implies that neutral models are robust to the
introduction of certain niche structures, but on the other
hand, it means that species abundance data will not always
be able to distinguish various models.


For example, fits of species–area curves by neutral models were not realistic [26,27] until long-distance dispersal was incorporated [28] (Box 3). This supports the general concept that long-distance dispersal is
important [29].

-------------
@Hubbell2005 Neutral theory in community ecology and the hypothesis of functional equivalence


The importance of trade-offs in resource use led Tilman (1994) to consider trade-offs in other life-history characteristics besides those involving resource exploitation, and here additional problems with the classical paradigm began to surface. In particular, Tilman revisited the old fugitive species concept of Hutchinson, and showed theoretically that if there was a strict transitive trade-off between competitive ability (site tenacity) and dispersal ability then, in principle, any arbitrary number of species could coexist.

However, soon thereafter, Hurtt & Pacala (1995) showed that Tilman’s trade-off assumption could be relaxed and that species of arbitrary competitive and dispersal abilities could coexist if dispersal and recruitment limitation were sufficiently strong. Hurtt and Pacala defined dispersal and recruitment limitation as the failure of species to reach and/or establish in all sites favourable for their growth and survival. When dispersal was infinite, such that all species reached all sites, then the best competitor won each site for which it was superior, the equilibrium solution expected from the classical theory. However, when dispersal and recruitment limitation were strong, many sites were won by default by competitively inferior species because the best competitor for the sites failed to reach them. Although the coexistence produced by this mechanism is non-equilibrium, Hurtt and Pacala showed that competitive exclusion could be essentially infinitely delayed. This result meant that Gause’s competitive exclusion principle was not generally true in spatial ecology. The slowness to reach equilibrium also depended on species richness.

A fuller theory of scaling behaviour is required to provide firmer connections between predicted and observed patterns of desertification---and so to provide a better understanding of the nature of transitions between green and desert phases.

@Manor2008 Facilitation, competition, and vegetation patchiness: From scale free distribution to patterns

Another mechanism that yields power-laws and other fat-
tailed distributions is multiplicative noise. This situation occurs
when the random fluctuations that affect the system are
proportional in magnitude to the size of the system itself. An
example is the neutral theory of species abundance (Hubbell,
2001); if the chances of any individual to produce an offspring and to die are the same, the abundance fluctuates along generations and the size of the fluctuation is proportional to the population.
This ‘‘law of proportion effect’’ was first discovered in the context
of business firm’s size (Gibrat, 1930; Simon and Bonini, 1958; Levy
and Solomon, 1996) and is also relevant to the effect of small Facilitation, competition, and vegetation patchiness: From scale free distribution to patterns

@Stumpf2012 Critical Truths About Power Laws

Moreover, knowledge of whether or not a distribution is heavy-tailed is far more important than whether it can be fit using a power law.

Suppose that one generates a large number of independent random variables xi drawn from heavy-tailed distributions, which need not be power laws. Then, by a version of the central limit theorem (CLT), the sum of these random variables is generically power-law distributed (www.informs-sim.org/wsc04papers/016.pdf).

@Fisher2014 The transition between the niche and neutral regimes in ecology


As a result, it is possible to drive a community between the niche and neutral phases by changing the environmental conditions. As an example, we consider the effects of selective logging on a population of butterflies in a tropical forest on Buru, Indonesia (32). Through habitat destruction, logging essentially moves the butterfly community from a position with high K/ω to one with low K/ω, tracing a path along the stochasticity axis in the phase diagram (Fig. 4A). Our model predicts that when a diverse community within the niche phase is placed under a stress that lowers K/ω to the critical value, it will undergo a transition to the neutral regime. LV sim- ulations show that this transition results in a collapse of biodiversity and leads to an increase in the skewness of the species abundance distribution

@Chase2007 Drought mediates the importance of stochastic community assembly

Here, I develop the hypothesis that the relative importance
of stochastic ecological drift and/or priority effects depend on the
harshness of the ecological filter in those habitats. I established
long-term experimental ponds to explore the relative importance
of community assembly history and drought on patterns of com-
munity compositional similarity among ponds that were otherwise
similar in their environmental conditions. I show considerable
site-to-site variation in pond community composition in the ab-
sence of drought that likely resulted from a combination of
stochastic ecological drift and priority effects. However, in ponds
that experienced drought, I found much higher similarity among
communities that likely resulted from niche-selection filtering out
species from the regional pool that could not tolerate such envi-
ronmental harshness

@Kefi2014

If the patterns are non-periodic or irregular
(in particular, if the patch-size distribution is described by a heavy-
tailed distribution), the patch size distribution may contain
information about the degradation level of the ecosystem but
more needs to be known about the underlying ecological
mechanisms to interpret the changes in the shape of this
distribution [15,20,46,60].


There are other
promising avenues of research to be pursued. Composite metrics
that combine spatial patterns with their temporal dynamics could

@Newman2005

What does it mean to say that a distribution has no finite mean? Surely we can take the data for real solar flares and calculate their average? Indeed we can, but this is only because the data set is of finite size. When α ≤ 2, the value of the mean x is dominated by the largest of the samples drawn from the distribution. For any data set of finite size this largest sample has a finite value and hence so does the mean. But the more samples we draw, the larger, on average, will be the largest of them, and hence the larger the mean as well. The divergence of Eq. (11) is telling us that as we go to larger and larger data sets, our estimate of the mean x will increase without bound. We discuss this more below.

@Pigolotti2013

The drastic assumptions of neutral theory favour mathematical tractability leading to analytical pre- dictions for ecological patterns such as species abundance distribution (see, e.g., Rosindell et al, 2011, and references therein). Such predictions, depending on few parameters, fit surprisingly well field data from tropical forests (see, e.g., Hubbell, 2001; Volkov et al., 2003, 2005). Due to its strong departure from traditional theoretical approaches, the neutral theory elicited a heated debate in community ecology about its validity and interpretation. A complication is that, in many cases, niche-based and neutral models yield similar fits of biodiversity patterns (see, e.g., Chave et al., 2002; McGill, 2003; Mouquet and Loreau, 2003; Tilman, 2004; McGill et al., 2006)

@Stauffer1994

The divergence of characteristic times (in our case the fire lifetime) at a critical point it is called "critical slowing down". For example for a temperature only slight below the liquid gas critical temperature, the fluid is quite unsure whether it wants to be liquid or vapour, and thus take a lot of time to make its choice.
