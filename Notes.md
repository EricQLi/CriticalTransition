# Notes

The most common species in a neutral community should coincide with the most common species in the metacommunity, probably a species with high dispersal capabilities. But a hierarchycal community, if the community is at steady state, the most common species will be the most competitive. If you study the traits of the most common and the community is near steady state you will know what are the principal forces structuring the community.

Beta-diversity:

The Sørensen index is $S_12/[0.5(S_1 + S_2 )]$, where S12
is the number of species common to both sites and
Si is the total found at site i. Jaccard’s index is
S12/(S1 + S2 - S12 ). For two plots, the probability
F can be calculated as F = SUM ͚f_i1 f_i2, where fij is the
relative abundance of species i at site j, and the
sum is over all species at both sites. More generally, F(r) can be calculated by finding all pairs of
trees separated by distances between r and $r + \Delta r$
and then determining what proportion of these
pairs are the same species.

A serious difficulty with this neutral model is its extreme sensitivity 
to the neutrality assumption. 

Once differences between species are allowed, then competitive 
exclusion is likely to occur rapidly.

More generally, the June 2006 issue of Ecology contained a series 
of papers in a special feature on 

neutral community ecology (Naeem, 2006). 

The degree of apparent community structure—niche rather than 
neutral— depends on many factors, including number of species (diversity), 
degree of niche overlap, dispersal abilities, and assumptions 
made about environmental variability (Gravel et al., 2006). 

The theme is re-echoed, with variations, by Bonsall et al. (2004b), 
who show how ‘organization dominated by niche structure and organization through chance and 
neutral processes’ can operate simultaneously, with varying weights, depending on the interplay between population dynamics (ecology) and life-history trade 
offs (evolution).

As in all such quests, it is good to keep in mind Einstein’s dictum, 
which translates roughly as ‘seek simplicity, and distrust 
it’.

It has been argued that observing patterns of species abundance 
typically predicted by neutral models cannot necessarily be 
taken as evidence of neutral processes (Purves & Pacala 2005), 
and our results concur with that. However, our results also show 
that the observed patterns can result from a neutral drift created 
by an elevated niche overlap, sustained by the constant reintro- 
duction of excluded species through high immigration and/ or 
speciation rates. Under such conditions, the rare species are 
transients and their occurrence depends on immigration; on 
the other hand, the resident species are permanent and their 
occurrence depends on niche differentiation (Magurran & Henderson 
2003; Schwilk & Ackerly 2005).

Some ecologists feel uncomfortable with neutral theory be cause 
it is wrong in the sense that it assumes species equivalence in 
the face of a vast literature cataloguing species differences 
and because it subsumes many undoubtedly real and well-researched 
ecological processes under the umbrella of stochasticity, 
which does not itself really constitute a force of nature (26).

We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinction.

Fixed-point attractor: we say that the dynamic
converged to a fixed-point attractor if the system
did not change in the frequency of occupied
patches in two successive generations.
Statistical steady-state: we say that the
dynamic converged to a statistical steady-state
when the proportion of cells in each state, as
measured by the Shannon entropy of the system,
remain bounded to very small fluctuations
around a fixed value, although the system
changes with no apparent trend over time.
Non-convergent: we say that the system did
not converge if after 10 500 generations we do
not find any of the above mentioned attractors.

@Gravel2006 Reconciling niche and neutrality: the continuum hypothesis.

Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity.

A community solely driven by competition will have a
deterministic succession, while a neutral community will
have the maximum stochasticity among replicated succes-
sions because of the neutral drift (Clark & McLachlan 2003).
We used this proxy to assess ÔneutralityÕ when we tested the
different predictions presented above.

The index was calculated after 500 time steps. This is not a sufficient
run length to reach a truly stable species composition, but
preliminary simulations showed that index differences
among scenarios were similar when the run length was
longer than 500 time steps

The percolation probability was
estimated using 500 · 500 lattices. The system is considered to be percolated when it has
at least one patch that spans from one edge of the system to the opposite edge. The
location of the percolation point is defined as the parameter value at which the percolation
probability is 0.5 (see the Results for further details about the percolation point).
The patch size distributions were obtained as follows. Simulations were run for
10 000 time units. The first 3000 transient time steps were discarded. Thereafter, patch
size data were recorded every 40 snapshots, to minimize any temporal correlation
among successive snapshots. Data from 175 such snapshots were used to plot the patch
size distribution.

# discussion
Our results suggest that tracking changes in patch size distributions
associated with knowledge on the connectedness of the system (and more specifically
on the presence or absence of spanning clusters) might provide qualitative information
regarding the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem.

Additionally, the patch size distribution can provide some information about
underlying ecological mechanisms. We showed that systems with the same cover (but
different underlying ecological mechanism) can be described by different distributions
(Fig. 2; Appendix S3). Considering a real ecosystem and knowing its fractional cover,
the patch size distribution can be compared with the patch size distribution generated
by a null model for the same fractional cover. An excess in large patches compared with
the null model would mean that local interactions might be at play, as a mechanism
promoting longer spatial correlations than expected otherwise.

@Orrock2010 Local community size mediates ecological drift and competition in metacommunities

The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e.g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt

@Fort2013a  Tropical Forests Are Non-Equilibrium Ecosystems Governed by Interspecific Competition Based on Universal 1/6 Niche Width

This niche width yields an average ratio of 0.25 between interspecific and intraspecific competition that corresponds to an intermediate value between the extreme claims of the neutral model and the classical niche-based model of community assembly (where interspecific competition is dominant).

@Martorell2014 Testing the roles of competition, facilitation and stochasticity on community structure in a species-rich assemblage

Most ecologists would agree that interactions and stochasticity occur concurrently in ecological communities. Neutrality may operate within subsets of closely related or convergent species (Leibold & McPeek 2006; Scheffer & van Nes 2006; Vergnon, Dulvy & Freckleton 2009), or among species pairs with similar fitness (equalizing mechanisms). However, increasing niche differentiation is required for coexistence to occur as asymmetries in competitive ability become greater (stabilizing mechanisms; Chesson 2000b; Adler, HilleRis- Lambers & Levine 2007). Furthermore, immigration may counteract competitive exclusion in interconnected metacommunities, reducing the degree of niche organization required for diversity maintenance (Gravel et al. 2006). Nevertheless, stochasticity is expected to set more restrictive conditions to coexistence in interaction-driven communities (May 1973; Tilman 2004; Adler & Drake 2008).

Empirical evidence is still insufficient to settle the conflict between these theories. Community patterns expected from theories based on interactions and stochasticity are frequently indistinguishable (Hubbell 2001; Chave, Muller-Landau & Levin 2002; Rosindell, Hubbell & Etienne 2011),

Our results, taken together with recent studies on tropical forests, suggest that weak
interactions among established plants may be a general phenomenon, but that local interactions dur-
ing colonization are important drivers of community composition.

Our study strongly suggests that a combination of niche-based and
equalizing processes best explains the patterns and species
dynamics within the L4 station marine phytoplankton
community (Table 2).
