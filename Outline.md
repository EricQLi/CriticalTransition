# A spatial phase transition between neutral and niche ecological communities

# The critical transition between hierarchical competition and neutrality in ecological communities

## Abstract

Ecological communities are shaped by a mixture of niche-based and neutral ecological processes. In neutral communities individuals are identical except for is abundance in a metacommunity and the dynamics is dominated by demographic stochasticity and dispersal. Niche communities can be represented by competitive hierarchies were replacement of competitive superior species occurs. Here I present the most simple model representing the continuum of neutral-niche communities. I add to a classical neutral model a competitive hierarchy where each species have a probability $\rho$ of replace another species that measures competitive intensity. 
In this model shows a phase transition between neutral an niche communities that produce a spanning cluster of the most competitive species is observed. The diversity (measured with Shannon index) have and abrupt fall but richness shows a slower decrease. The critical point is observed at a very low value of the competitive intensity, thus weak competition can have a strong effect on communities. Some recent studies suggest that most communities present weak competitive interactions thus they may be near the critical point, understanding the dynamics this phase transition will be very important to prevent shifts in community structure.  

## Abstract (to present the model and this lack of trade-off)

Ecological communities are shaped by a mixture of niche-based and neutral ecological processes. In neutral communities individuals are identical except for is abundance in a metacommunity and the dynamics is dominated by demographic stochasticity and dispersal. Niche communities can be represented by competitive hierarchies and to maintain diversity some form of trade-off is assumed. Here I present the most simple model representing the continuum of neutral-niche communities. I add to a classical neutral model a competitive hierarchy where each species have a probability $\rho$ of replace another species. 
The model shows a phase transition between neutral an niche communities that produce a biodiversity collapse. This phase transition is characteristic of some ecological systems and has been termed robust criticality. Here we describe for the first time the observation of this kind of criticality for a community assembly model.  

* There is a critical transition from neutral communities to competitive communities, when the degree of competition reachs the critical value there is a sharp drop in the Shannon diversity, the number of species drops more slowly

* We studied this effect using spatially explicit models using both number of species and shannon equitativity index 

* We defined as tunning parameter the probability of replacement of individuals of different species, the order parameter is size of spanning cluster.

* This could be produced in natural communities by a change in enviromental conditions like the ones produced by climatic change. 
* The transition could be reversible depending on the metacommunity migration. If the degree of competition go back to previous levels the community will become neutral again and the species will come back. 

* If the environmental conditions change in some place and not in others (patchy metacommunity environment) the local community could be restored faster.

* 2nd Paper make explicit the spatial distribution of $\rho$ 

## Introduction


* Why Phase transitions are important for ecology

The problems of pattern and scale are critical in ecology [@Chave2013; @Levin1992], because patterns that seem stochastic at one scale may reveal structrure at another scale, when we are turning the know of our ecological microscope some patterns appear and dissapear while we change the focus. But there are some patterns that cross scales, and these patterns are produced by critical transitions. The concept of pattern is related to some sort of repetition that our brain can detect, but when this pattern repeats at different scales we talk about scale invariance or auto-similarity  A phase transition is... 

* Continuum between Neutral/competitive models 


* We demostrate a phase transition between hierarchical competition and neutral states of a community 

* In an homogeneous environment this results in a sudden loss of species and equitativity

* Fragmentation modifies the critical point towards lower values of the competitive intensity
