# The critical transition between neutral and competitive communities  


* There is a critical transition from neutral communities to competitive communities, when the degree of competition reachs the critical value there is a sharp drop in the Shannon diversity, the number of species drops more slowly

* We studied this effect using spatially explicit models using both number of species and shannon equitativity index 

* We defined as tunning parameter the probability of replacement of individuals of different species, the order parameter is size of spanning cluster.

* This could be produced in natural communities by a change in enviromental conditions like the ones produced by climatic change. 
* The transition could be reversible depending on the metacommunity migration. If the degree of competition go back to previous levels the community will become neutral again and the species will come back. 

* If the environmental conditions change in some place and not in others (patchy metacommunity environment) the local community could be restored faster.

* 2nd Paper make explicit the spatial distribution of $\rho$ 

## Introduction


* Continuum between Neutral/competitive models 

* Phase transitions in ecology

* We demostrate a phase transition between hierarchical competition and neutral states of a community 

* In an homogeneous environment this results in a sudden loss of species and equitativity
