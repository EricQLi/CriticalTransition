## Appendix 1: Barro colorado Island forest plot discretization procedure

To analyze the patch distribution of BCI plot we first have to discretized the positions of the trees to fit them in a lattice. In each position only one individual of a particular species can be present, this is the same assumption that we made for the model that we use in the paper above. 

We have to choose a length scale to make the discretization, if we intend to fit all the individuals of all species in a different site the scale should be around 0.10 m for this plot, as the plot has 1000m x 500 m, that would result in an big lattice of 10000x5000 sites with a great proportion of empty places. This will result in a majority of isolated sites with almost no patches. If we use a bigger scale e.g. of 0.5 m, more than 1 individual of possibly different species get in some of the sites, in these cases we have to decide which one will occupy the site. We establish that the one with greater dbh, no matter the species, will be the one that occupies the site, thus we are favoring the more mature individuals.

In this process we have to find the scale that give us the maximal occupation of the lattice without loosing the species structure of the community. Then the criteria to stop enlarging the scale is that the species abundance distribution (SAD) of the discretized lattice has not to be statistically different from the original SAD. To test this we use the Anderson-Darling statistic with a randomization procedure using the R package kSamples [1], this statistic has been proved powerful to detect different kinds of communities [2]. Using this procedure we obtained a scale of 1 m, thus we used a lattice of 1000x500 sites.

The parameters are mean dispersal distance (Dispersal), metacommunity number of species (MetaNsp), and migration ($m$).

Table: Proportion of best models for patch size distributions from simulated neutral/niche model communities. We fitted 3 models to the patch distributions: exponential, power law (Pow) and power law with exponential cutoff (PowExp). The best model was selected using the Akaike information criteria. We made 30 simulations in a range of $\rho$ (see methods) and we used the following parameters: metacommunities have 64 species and two different species abundance distributions (SAD): logseries SAD; and uniform SAD; The size of the grid was 256*256 sites, migration=0.00016, and dispersal distance=26.66.

\caption{Largest patch for a spatial neutral/niche model as a function of the intensity of competition $\rho$. The columns represent two different metacommunity types: Logseries, a metacommunity with logseries species abundance distribution (SAD); Uniform, a metacommunity with a uniform SAD. The rows represent the largest patch relative to total area $S_{max}$ and the largest patch relative to the species area $RS_{max}$. The vertical line is the critical point, which is the value for parameter $\rho$ where a phase transition between neutral and niche phases occurs. The parameters used were: side of the simulation lattice was 256 sites, the number of species in the metacomunity was 320, the metacommunity migration $m$=0.0001 and the dispersal distance = 26.66.}
